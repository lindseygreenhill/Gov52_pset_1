## Problem 2a. Page 27 of textbook

```{r data, echo=FALSE}
births <- tibble(prop_girls = 
                   c(.4777,
                     .4875,
                     .4859,
                     .4754,
                     .4874,
                     .4864,
                     .4813,
                     .4787,
                     .4895,
                     .4797,
                     .4876,
                     .4859, .4857, .4907, .5010, .4903, .4860, .4911, .4871, .4725, .4822, .4870, .4823, .4973))

```


```{r}

# calculating standard deviation

sd(births$prop_girls)

# averaging the proportions above and dividing by the square root of the sample
# size. So p bar divided by the square root of the number. Dividing by 24
# because we have 24 data points so that is our sample size.

avg_birth <- mean(births$prop_girls)

std_theoretical <- sqrt(avg_birth * (1 - avg_birth) / 24)
```

## Problem 2b

```{r}
# use the chi-squared test to do this with 23 df. Finding the upper and lower bound and seeing if the chi squared test above is within these bounds. 

lower_bound <- qchisq(.05/2, df = 23)
upper_bound <- qchisq(.975, df = 23)

```
